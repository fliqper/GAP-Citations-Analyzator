# GAP-Citations-Analyzator
GAP Citations project
*The GAP citations dataset was assembled using the MathSciNet database. We would like to express our gratitude to the American Mathematical Society for giving us such opportunity.

The project will have 3 main stages (1) data retrieval, (2) cleaning the data, (3) analysis and visualisations

Do manual check on several scraping results !


   


Mention SageMath, Magma and SIngular in the report - how they do Bibliography compared to GAP, how they stimulate citers to report  etc ???
