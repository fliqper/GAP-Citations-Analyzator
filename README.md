# GAP-Citations-Analyzator /working title/
GAP Citations project
The project will have 3 main stages (1) data retrieval, (2) cleaning the data, (3) analysis and visualisations

Perhaps I should improve some variable names and add more comments to the notebook explaining each step, once it is clear that it all works and no more changes will be made.

Need to clean up the python file, also find a way from CS2006 to run scrapings.py with file argument, such as test-data or real-data.
