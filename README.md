# GAP-Citations-Analyzator /working title/
GAP Citations project
The project will have 3 main stages (1) data retrieval, (2) cleaning the data, (3) analysis and visualisations

Perhaps I should improve some variable names and add more comments to the notebook explaining each step, once it is clear that it all works and no more changes will be made.
